TODO

* somehow trap parse and fatal errors, tell about, but basically ignore
    (for the Docker snippets looper)
* finish (and configure in run_all_snippets.php) the snippets for 5.5 operational details
* oops, the PHP 7.1 snippets (study guide and operational details) are totally empty!


INTRO

A couple of things that are helping me study for the PHP 7.1 exam.
They are:

* Snippets
* Quiz

Snippets are the code samples (runnable via Docker) from the "test your knowledge"
questions in both the official PHP 5.5 and
PHP 7.1 study guides (note that both study guides have nearly identical questions and code samples).
There are also snippets covering key operational details for
both of these PHP versions.

Quiz is more fun - it scrapes the function specification pages of the php.net
docs to present quizes! (a Laravel CLI app running in a Vagrant box)
